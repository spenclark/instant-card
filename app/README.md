### Objectives
Design and ship a modern web app demo for the InstantCard team. Research done on the InstantCard product & industry informs that users convert much better when they are given sample cards. I should go about designing and building with the intent improve on the current onboarding and sample/lead generation flow.

**Post Sprint Notes:** _I did some research on google search trends. I think the SEO results for a product "Free Employee ID designer" would drive good traffic. Canva did this successfully!_
