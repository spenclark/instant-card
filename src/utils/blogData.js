    body: "You are probably not aware that the common “prox” or key cards used to open 100’s of thousands of doors across America can be copied by anyone in a matter of minutes.  Even though these passive prox cards are used by some of America’s largest and most tech-savvy companies, most people will be shocked to learn that these key cards can be easily copied by nearly anyone, in just a few seconds.  Should you be concerned?  If you have responsibility for physical security in a corporate environment, the answer is a resounding “yes”. When the low-frequency (125 kHz) prox technology was introduced in the 1990’s it was considered quite secure at the time.  A combination of many site codes and a large number of unique serial numbers meant that it was highly unlikely that one key card was able to open the doors in an unauthorized building.  But as the number of cards in use proliferated, previously low probability became increasingly higher because there were only 255 unique site codes built into the original card’s technical design.  And to make matters worse, over time more and more people backward-engineered the cards in an effort to compromise their security.",

    body: "After nearly six months of development and testing, as well as extensive security validations, InstantCard is pleased to announce that its ID card app is now listed on the ADP Workforce Now® Marketplace, and available to all ADP and InstantCard customers.  This will greatly improve the efficiency with which those corporate clients which use both services will be able to manage their daily operations. Clients are now able to ensure automatic syncing between the master ADP HR database, and the InstantCard ID card database.  New hires, promotions, and terminations which are recorded in the online ADP HR system will be automatically reflected in the InstantCard system.  When a client first signs up, they are presented with an “import” button which allows them to receive into the InstantCard service all data, or a filtered subset of data, from their ADP account.  From that point on, any changes in the cloud-based ADP system will be sent, on a nightly basis, to InstantCard via our API.  However, clients can also at any time click a button to sync changes which have been made to ensure continuous full consistency.",
